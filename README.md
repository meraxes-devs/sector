Computing galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs) following stellar population synthesis generated by [STARBURST99](https://www.stsci.edu/science/starburst99/docs/default.htm). This includes the spectrum, the rest-frame photometry and observed magnitudes within the HST or JWST NIRCam filters. See `examples/` for demonstration.

Sector is designed to work along with the [Meraxes](https://github.com/smutch/meraxes) semi-analytic galaxy-formation code either by post-processing outputs from Meraxes or by running together on the fly. However, it can also be used without Meraxes as long as the star formation history is provided in the required format.

To use the python module, simply install the package by e.g., `pip install -e .`. To use sector as a library on the fly, check [Meraxes](https://github.com/smutch/meraxes) for more instruction.
