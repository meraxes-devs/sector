Computing galaxy spectral energy distributions following stellar population synthesis. This includes the spectrum, the rest-frame photometry and observed magnitudes within the HST or JWST NIRCam filters. Sector is designed to work along with the [Meraxes](https://github.com/smutch/meraxes) semi-analytic galaxy-formation code either by post-processing outputs from Meraxes (see `examples/` for demonstration) or by running together on the fly (see [Meraxes](https://github.com/smutch/meraxes) for instruction). 

The Pop.II spectra are generated using [STARBURST99](https://www.stsci.edu/science/starburst99/docs/default.htm) assuming a Kroupa or Salpeter IMF (see [Qiu et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.489.1357Qi) for more details). The Pop. III spectra are taken from [Raiter et al. 2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A%26A...523A..64R) assuming 4 different Pop. III IMFs: Salpeter [1 - 500] Msun, Salpeter [50 - 500] Msun, Log-Normal with characteristic mass = 10 Msun and Log-Normal with characteristic mass = 60 Msun (see [Ventura et al. 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240107396V) for more details).
